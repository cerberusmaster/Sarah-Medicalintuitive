          <p>As a Medical Intuitive Healer, Sarah does not need to see you in person in order to help.
            Her intuitive ability opens up when she hears or otherwise learns what's not working or what's wrong.
            Her mind simply supplies answers. Not only does she learn the actual cause, she knows what needs to be
            done to get back to normal.</p>
          <p>In order to pass on what she learned, you are invited to schedule a free consultation with Sarah.
            Experience has taught her that 20 minutes is plenty of time to do that.</p>
          <p>If you choose to go longer, you can. After 20 minutes, the fee is $38.00 for each one to ten minute increment.</p>

        <p>
          In the mid-1800's well over 38,000 were individually healed of their various diseases
          and aliments without medicine by one Dr. Phineas Parkhurst Quimby (1802-1866). He
          claimed that he healed as Jesus did.
        </p>
        <p>
          I set out to find out. . .First, if that were true. And, if it were true, how did he do it.
          And if he had, did he leave a way others could learn to do the same?
        </p>
        <p>
          I did find out! Historical records prove he healed thousands without medicine. And, he
          left an extensive number of detailed handwritten papers explaining how he did it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hundreds of newspaper articles and letters that praised Dr. Quimby's method donated to The Library of Congress.
          I also gathered an extensive library on Quimby . . . included were some papers written in his own hand, personal letters,
          philosophical manuscripts on healing, and patient files containing testimonials.
        </p>
        <p>It is a fact. Dr. Quimby had heal thousands without medicine.</p>
        <p>Eventually I learned how to heal as he did.</p>
        <div class="col-md-10">

          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          In 1858, at 57 Quimby realized that he knew how Jesus healed. He opened an office
          in Portland, Maine. His results were astounding. The newspapers of his day report he used no
          medicine, therapy or equipment. Patient's who were healed said he only talked to them.
        </p>
        <p>Overwhelmed with patients, he died of overwork seven years after opening his office.

        <p>Quimby wrote that his foundation for healing was based upon knowing the truth.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          <i>
            "All disease, all discomfort is the result of an opinion, in essence, a lie individuals believe
            about themselves or their life. Find the lie for them, tell them the truth and you've given back their
            health. The truth is always the cure. All disease, all discomfort, all the things you have going
            wrong in your life are the result of opinions." - P. P. Quimby
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          I studied and experimented for months before I fully understood what he meant. Quimby's
          Method of healing is so simple that for some reason my mind couldn't grasp it. It took
          months to understand, let alone being able to heal people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quimby wrote that when we are unwell or unhappy, there was something that we started to believe ourselves or
          life that wasn't true. When we learn the truth that belief will automatically dissolve and problems/symptoms disappear
          Almost overnight we recover.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>
            Look back at what Quimby wrote. The key word in the paragraph is <u><b>opinion</b></u>.<br>
            <i>... "All disease, all discomfort <b>is the result of an opinion</b>, in essence, a lie individuals believe
            about themselves or their life.</i>
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          An opinion by definition is actually a belief about something <b><u>that is not true. It's somthing not based on fact</u></b>
          or actual knowledge. It's usually just something someone made up.

          <b>An Actual Demonstration of<br>Quimby's Method</b>
        </h1>
        <p>
          One hundred twenty-five doctors were given an opportunity to observe
          the dramatic effect of Quimby's Method Session.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the result of a glass shower door accident, Lisa Franklin spent the evening in the
          emergency room. In all she required 8 stitches and pain medication. Lisa's husband was one of
          the doctors scheduled to attend the Quimby's Method demonstration in the morning. He called
          to ask Sarah if she would use his wife for one of the demonstrations in order to relieve her pain.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was told that if she remained drug free, she could be the first demonstration. The
          following morning, Lisa, pale from pain, came forward to sit on the tall bar stool at the front of
          the room. She had her elbow cupped and held her hand up to avoid an increase of blood flow
          and pain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Five of the doctors examined her hand. It was a puffy, red, swollen mass with four, thick
          black X's where the emergency room doctor had put in the stitches. Their conclusion, her hand
          was typical of one that had suffered a deep cut within the previous 18 hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sarah stood beside her stool so the audience could see that she did not touch her. Thirty
          minutes into the session, Lisa didn't seem to notice (but the audience did) that she'd put her
          hand down when she started laughing. An hour later, still not touching her, Sarah asked if her
          hand hurt.
        </p>
        <p>
          She looked bewildered, as if she'd forgotten why she was sitting in front of 125 people.
          At first, she use one finger and gently felt her palm. Then she poked it. What she did next
          surprised even Sarah. Several times she slammed her palm against the edge of the stool. She
          looked a little confused when she said, "There's no pain. It doesn't hurt at all."
        </p>
        <p>
          The doctors re-examined her hand. There was no sign of an injury; just four black X's.
          The skin showed no sign that it had been pulled back together. No puffiness. No redness. No
          thin red line.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Russell Loveland, a Chiropractor in practice for over twenty years, was in the audience.

              who knew how to heal using logic alone, I knew<br>
                they had something. After that demonstration,<br>
              I realized that this method is the<br>

        <h2 class="text-center m-5"><b>"After the pain left, I was scared! I could actually<br>
          'see' inside things and knew things I shouldn't!"</b></h2>
        <p>
          What happened to Sarah is typical of what happens to cause a person to become a Medical Intuitive. Forty plus years ago she
          was stopped in the left hand turn lane for a red light. She glanced up just as the car behind
          struck her pickup. The police said the teen was going approximately 50 m.p.h. at impact. He
          told them that he thought he could beat the light, that he just didn't see the truck.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sarah's head flew forward into the windshield then snapped back into the rear window.
          The truck went up, came down and was struck again. Her head slammed into the side window.
        </p>
        <h2 class="p-title m-5">
          "Unknowingly, overnight,<br>I had become a Medical Intuitive."
        </h2>

        <p>Days passed before the pain from the blows to her head subsided. During her convalescence
          from the accident, she stayed with her parents so that her father -a chiropractor-
          could treat her injuries. As the pain eased, she was shaken! She could actually see
          through and inside things. She 'heard' things a normal person shouldn't/couldn't know. She
          describes it as being similar to hearing a radio commentator or watching a movie unfold with
          scenes surrounding an incident. Since she'd had no exposure to the metaphysical new age
          world or quantum physics, she was at a loss to understand what had happened.</p>

        <p>She shared seeing and knowing things she shouldn't with her father. Instead of being
          scared as she was, he was excited.</p>

        <p>
          He told her that he'd heard about what she was describing...This all took place before
          the internet...He'd read about two men who had similar abilities. Edgar Cayce a psychic
          healer and Peter Hurkos a carpenter, turned psychic from a blow to his head when he fell
          from his ladder.</p>

        <p>Before that day Sarah had never heard the word psychic. The only place she found
          information about psychics, Cayce and Hurkos was in a couple of out-of-print books.
          Comparing their experiences to hers, she was relieved to know that she wasn't crazy or possessed.
          She accepted that she was actually "seeing" inside bodies and things.</p>
        <span class="text-center seperator">~ &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; ~</span>

        <p>Sarah's injury happened over 48 years ago. Today it's evident that she suffered what
          is called a contrecoup injury a traumatic, widespread injury to the brain
          being bruised due to a blow to the head.</p>

        <p>Her first experience with her new abilities happened while she was sitting in her
          father's waiting for treatment. She realized that she knew what
          happened to a patient sitting next to her. And she knew what needed to be done for her to
          recover.</p>

        <p>Even today, within seconds of hearing a symptom or problem, she understands the
          situation, usually knows what caused it and what to do to recover.</p>

        <span class="text-center seperator">~ &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; ~</span>

        <p>It was difficult for Sarah to explain what she was seeing. At the time of the crash her
          life was simple. She was the owner-operator of a small bookstore.</p>

        <p>When it's not an opinion causing the body to malfunction, it may be that the body just needs a certain
          food(s) to heal. Why?
          Food is both a building blocks and a medicine. With just the right quality and combination,
          the body usually has the ability heal itself.</p>

        <p>Whether it's a long term illness, a problem at work or in a relationship, finances or
          something new, when Sarah thinks about you, she'll see inside your issue and see what
          caused it.</p>

        <p>As she continues to focus, she'll silently ask herself questions, such as, "What else
          contributed to this?" Even today, over 48 years after that contrecoup injury, she still gets
          answers.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title"><b>Why is This Free?</b></h2>

        <p>Not everyone can afford what it takes to simply find out what they need to do to recover.
          I've been doing this work for close to fifty years. I like doing it. As most of you know, it feels really
          good to give. So, I'm giving. If I know something I can pass on that will make your life easier,
          I'm going to do it.</p>

          supplements to get the poisons out of her body.</p><p class="cmb-0">
          It was 4 months before she email again. She e-mailed to say "Thank you". She said it
          took her 3 months to get the poison out but now her legs were straight as they should be.</p><p class="cmb-0">
          While bedridden she was able to support herself translating English books into Japanese
          for an author. Able to walk, she wrote that she was able to take the subway to and from her new
          higher paying job.</p><p class="cmb-0">
          About three years later she flew to Canada to visit her sister. It was there that she met
          her future husband.</p>
